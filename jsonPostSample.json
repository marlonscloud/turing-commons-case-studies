    "overview": "<p>A for-profit company has developed a peer-to-peer support<br />service for individuals wishing to share experiences and seek<br />advice from others with lived experiences of mental health<br />issues.</p> <p><br />This system is marketed to institutions such as schools,<br />universities, and workplaces as a tool which can improve wellbeing as well as productivity.</p> <p><br />The appeal of these peer-to-peer support platforms is<br />significantly dependent on the fact users feel comfortable<br />sharing personal details thanks to their anonymity. Therefore,<br />all users are (by default) anonymous on the site and, in the vast<br />majority of cases, can message one another free from outside<br />intervention.</p> <p><br />However, when certain combinations of &lsquo;trigger words&rsquo; are<br />entered into the system, indicating a user is at risk of causing<br />harm to themselves or others, the incident is escalated. In these<br />cases, the institutional mental health lead is notified, and<br />anonymity is broken. The individual is then given personal<br />assistance and intervention.</p><p><br />Consent for this platform does indicate that anonymity may be<br />breached in extreme scenarios, but it does not detail the specific<br />triggers of case escalation. Nor does it detail the means by<br />which algorithmic technqiues are used to identity &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; users.</p>",
